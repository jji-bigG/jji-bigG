## 🧱 Currently Working On 🏗️
#### 🏦 Owe Me [github](/jji-bigG/owe-me)
Self Hosted Sveltekit app that lets you track your loans and personal finances; mainly as a way to learn a new web framework other than React, NextJS.
#### 🎓 CourseSphere [github](/LambdaAK/CourseSphere)
LLM+RAG app that answers all your questions about courses, professors, programs of study here at Cornell. We have our own Frontend, but also integrates with Telegram, Discord bots. We have over 100+ monthly active users serving over 250 messages a day. CourseSphere is a great way to discover those niche and hidden courses that you might have overlooked when browsing through over 19k course offerings at Cornell, 8k faculties...
#### 👨‍💻 VPS playground
one stop shop for all my experiments in DevOps engineering, linux deployments, self hosted solutions, and VPN server for my privacy.
## 🏛️ Finished Products ⚙️
#### Portfolio Website: Uses the standard React + Tailwind and hosted on my own VPS & Netlify. Also at (http://172.245.184.138:3030)[http://172.245.184.138:3030]
#### 🕸️ Course Roster [github](/jji-bigG/cornell-course-roster)
web scraping project that builds the knowledge base & vectorstore (pinecone.io) for CourseSphere (over 300 megabytes of raw & preprocessed data from Cornell, RateMyProfessors, Reddit, ...). It started with Requests + BeautifulSoup, but later evolved into more advanced tools like Scrapy, or even Selenium. I also had to prompt LLM's to preprocessing our raw data to filter & extract insights on our data (which is available on my Kaggle).
#### 🤖 My ML Lib [github](/jji-bigG/my_ml_lib)
As an excercise after CS 4780 Intro to ML, I decided to reimplement what I had learned and package them into a Python library.
## 🛠️ Tools I am familiar with 🧰
In the various projects and ventures, I had used various programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and coding/SWE strategies to achieve my target functionalities.

These are tools I have REAL PROJECTS or INTERNSHIPS to back up the claim.
### Programming Languages
- Python: Mainly for data works; used multithreading & async await in mass sending OpenAI calls to self hosted QWen 110B instances at LeYan 乐言.
- Typescript
- OCaml: From CS 3110, which I am a TA of. I cannot share more than this for academic honestly purposes.
- Java: Every real dev knows this
- Go: Reading the Building Interpreters in Go textbook
- Rust: a quick glance & skim through the Rust Book since everyone is talking about it
### Libraries & Frameworks
- Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium
- Web Development: NextJS, SvelteKit, VueJS
- AI/ML related: HuggingFace 🤗!, Pinecone, OpenAI SDK (hot take: langchain is useless, and their docs are confusing)
### Microservices & DevOps Solutions
- CI Pipelines: Jenkins
- Database: Postgres
- Auth: I roll out my own auth with the access & refresh tokens in my side projects. I don't want to pay hefty sums to Clerk or Auth0
